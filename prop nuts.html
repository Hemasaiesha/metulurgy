    Nuts and bolts are essential fasteners used in various applications, from construction to manufacturing. The choice of nuts and bolts depends on the specific requirements of the application. Here are some key properties to consider when selecting nuts and bolts:

    <ol><li><h2>Material</h2></li>
   <h3>Corrosion Resistance:-</h3> Depending on the environment, nuts and bolts may be exposed to moisture and corrosive substances. 
  <h4> Common materials include </h4>
   <ul><li>stainless steel</li>
    <li>galvanized steel</li>
    <li>and brass for enhanced corrosion resistance.</li>
    </ul>
 <li><h2>Strength:-</h2></li>
   <h4>Tensile Strength:-</h4>
    The ability of the material to withstand tension forces without breaking.
     <h5>High-tensile steel</h5>is often used for applications requiring high strength.
   <h4>Yield Strength:-</h4> The point at which a material begins to deform plastically. It's crucial for preventing permanent deformation of the fastener.

   <li> <h2>Temperature Resistance:-</h2></li>
    For applications exposed to elevated temperatures, 
   materials with high-temperature resistance may be required.

 <li><h2>Thread Type:-</h2></li>
   <h3>Coarse vs. Fine Threads:-</h3>
    Coarse threads are more resistant to vibration, while fine threads offer better accuracy and are suitable for applications requiring higher torque.

 <li><h2>Head Type:-</h2></li>
   <ul><li>Hex Head, </li>
   <li>Round Head, </li>
   <li>Flat Head, etc.</li></ul>
   Different head types are suitable for various applications. 
   <pre></pre>
   For example, hex heads are commonly used for applications where a wrench or socket is needed.
