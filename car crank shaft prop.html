    <h1>CRANK SHAFT</h1>
    The crankshaft is a crucial component in a car's engine, responsible for converting the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion. It operates under significant stresses and must possess certain properties to ensure durability and reliable performance. The properties required for a car crankshaft include:

<OL><LI><H2>High Strength:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> The crankshaft is subjected to high mechanical stresses due to the reciprocating motion of the pistons. High tensile and yield strength are essential to prevent deformation or failure.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Fatigue Resistance:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> The crankshaft undergoes repeated cycles of loading and unloading as the engine operates. Resistance to fatigue is crucial to ensure long-term durability and prevent failure from cyclic loading.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Hardness:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> The surface hardness of the crankshaft is important for wear resistance. Hardness helps in resisting abrasion and maintaining the integrity of bearing surfaces.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Wear Resistance:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> The crankshaft experiences sliding and rolling motions at various bearing points. Wear resistance is critical to prevent premature wear and maintain the dimensional accuracy of the crankshaft.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Ductility:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> While high strength is necessary, some degree of ductility is important to absorb shocks and vibrations without becoming brittle. Ductility helps prevent catastrophic failure.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Machinability:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> The material should be easily machinable to allow for the precise manufacturing of the crankshaft's intricate features, such as journals and crankpins.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Corrosion Resistance:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> While not directly exposed to the elements like some other engine components, the crankshaft should have sufficient corrosion resistance to withstand the conditions within the engine.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Dimensional Stability:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> The crankshaft must maintain its dimensional stability under various operating temperatures to ensure proper alignment and functionality.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Heat Resistance:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> The crankshaft operates in a high-temperature environment due to combustion. Heat resistance is crucial to prevent softening or degradation of mechanical properties at elevated temperatures.
</LI></UL>
<LI><H2>Weight Efficiency:-</H2></LI>

<UL><LI><H3>Explanation:-</H3> While providing high strength, the material should be selected to keep the weight of the crankshaft reasonable. This contributes to overall engine efficiency and reduces rotating mass.
